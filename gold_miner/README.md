## Welcome to Gold Miner!
#### Qing Xiao, MPCS

- Firstly, I set the opening page. You can click **Click here to start!** to start the game.
- Then, you can choose your favorite miner!
- In the game, the hook line will automatically swing left and right. 
- Gold and stones will appear inside the mud below. They have different value, weights. 
When you find your hook is in a good position, click the left mouse button quickly! 
The hook will extend at a certain speed and return when it touches something, the speed of return is determined by the weight of that thing. 
**(Attention: The stone is cheap, but it is heavy!)**
- In higher levels, dangerous worms will appear. Once the hook touches the worm, it will be eaten, and you will lose all your points. 
Unfortunately, your game is over then.
- At the same time, you cannot do nothing for a long time. You must hit the target score within the time limit to proceed to the next level. Don't run out your time!
- Each user has an initial 3 magic potions. When you are retrieving the hook line, click the right mouse button to use the potion and speed up the retrieval.
- When the countdown is over, and you reach the target score, you will enter the store where you can buy magic potions with the points you have. Click the left mouse button to purchase, and right click to abandon the purchase.




PS:  I found that Sometimes when open the game, there will be a thread jamming. 
I don't know why (maybe because of thread congestion). This time, you can close the window and reopen the game
